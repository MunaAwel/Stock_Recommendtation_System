ðŸ“ˆ Stock_Recommendation_System
ðŸ“Œ Overview
Stock_Recommendation_System is a scalable, near-real-time analytics pipeline that delivers intelligent stock recommendations by combining real-time user feedback, historical stock data, and sentiment from financial news.

This system uses K-Means Clustering to segment stocks or users based on behavioral, financial, and sentiment-driven features, enabling group-specific recommendations. It is powered by a big data architecture using Kafka, Spark, SQL + HDFS, and deployed in Docker on Ubuntu.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
ðŸ§° Languages & Libraries
Python â€“ for preprocessing, clustering, and pipeline development

scikit-learn â€“ K-Means implementation and clustering utilities

NLTK / VaderSentiment â€“ NLP sentiment analysis

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ data manipulation and visualization

ðŸ’» Infrastructure & Storage
Apache Kafka â€“ real-time ingestion of user feedback

Apache Spark â€“ distributed data processing for feature engineering

MySQL / PostgreSQL â€“ structured data storage (stock metadata, user profiles)

Hadoop HDFS â€“ unstructured data storage (news articles, feedback logs)

Docker â€“ containerized deployment

Ubuntu (Linux) â€“ development and deployment OS

ðŸ§  Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering
Used K-Means Clustering to group:

Stocks with similar volatility, price trends, and sentiment

Users with similar investment behaviors or feedback patterns

Cluster insights were used to generate group-specific stock recommendations

Helped tailor risk profiles and suggested strategies for different user groups

ðŸ’¡ Key Features & Contributions
âš¡ Real-Time Kafka Ingestion: Collected user feedback (ratings/comments) and injected into the system.

ðŸ“Š Hybrid Storage Architecture:

Structured data (SQL): user metadata, stock metrics

Unstructured data (HDFS): news articles, raw feedback

ðŸ“ˆ Spark ETL Jobs: Performed clustering and data transformation at scale

ðŸ“° Sentiment Analysis Engine: Extracted and scored sentiment from 500+ financial articles to augment clustering

ðŸ§  Unsupervised ML: K-Means revealed market segments and stock clusters for targeted recommendations

ðŸ”„ Scalable & Modular Design: Fully containerized and ready for deployment

ðŸ“Š Output & Results
ðŸ“Œ User/Stock Clusters: Stocks grouped by performance, volatility, and sentiment traits

ðŸ’¬ User Feedback Clustering: Tailored recommendations based on group behavior

ðŸ“ˆ Insights Dashboard: Visualized clusters, sentiment impact, and stock segments

âœ… Improved relevance of recommendations and risk-adjusted decisions
